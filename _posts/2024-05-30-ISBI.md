Exciting news!
This week Matteo participated to the 21st IEEE [International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2024/) in Athens, from 27 to 30th May.

At the conference, he presented our contribution entitled "Brain MRI synthesis using StyleGAN2-ADA", showing that even an expert radiologist could not distinguish the synthetic images from the real ones!
