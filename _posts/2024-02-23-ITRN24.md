Today, Giulia and Prof. Stefano Diciotti joined the [Third Annual ITRN Meeting](https://www.itrn.org/itrn-scientific-events/itrn-meeting) hosted at the University of Bologna.

The symposium aimed to analyze the activities of the several organizations and research groups dedicated to promoting open science in Italy.

During the event, we had the privilege of presenting two contributions:
- **Extending BIDS to lung CT imaging: right here, right now** - *Giulia Raffaella De Luca, Armand Violle, Stefano Diciotti*
- **Decoding the dilemma: reproducibility pitfalls in Machine Learning with limited medical data** - *Stefano Diciotti, Matteo Lai, Chiara Marzi*

> The meeting was a great place for engaging discussions about open science relevance and methodologies with other peers  who share a strong commitment to this mission.
