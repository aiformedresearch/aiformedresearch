Today, Giulia and Laura concluded the [Advanced School in Artificial Intelligence](https://asai-er.github.io/) located in Bertinoro (FC)!

The School lasted two weeks and the lessons where held in the beautiful [Centro Residenziale Universitario Ce.U.B of Bertinoro](https://www.ceub.it/). The lessons provided an immersive dive into the world of Artificial Intelligence, encompassing everything from foundational mathematical concepts to cutting-edge trends. The program also featured interactive lab sessions, allowing students to collaborate on coding challenges. 

> "Engaging with fellow students during the lab sessions was particularly rewarding: we had the opportunity to work together and share our ideas, mixing up the knowledge from our heterogeneous backgrounds. These hands-on activities truly enriched my learning experience and being in such a beautiful environment was a precious bonus." (Giulia)

> "Taking part in the summer school was a great opportunity for me to learn more about AI and its applications. I had the lucky chance to meet people with different backgrounds and discuss with them about their research and work was extremely interesting." (Laura)
