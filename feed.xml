The School lasted two weeks and the lessons where held in the beautiful <a href="https://www.ceub.it/">Centro Residenziale Universitario Ce.U.B of Bertinoro</a>. The lessons covered the most important topics in the Artificial Intelligence field, from the mathematical basis to the latest trends. Some time was also dedicated to lab sessions, in which we could team with the other students and share our ideas to complete some coding challenges. It was a pleasure to build up my knowledge and network in such wonderful context!</p>
