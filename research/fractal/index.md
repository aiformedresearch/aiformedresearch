Background: The brain exhibits a remarkable degree of statistical self-similarity, and its complexity can be effectively described using fractal geometry. Fractal descriptors provide a valuable means of detecting subtle changes in the brain and monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. These descriptors capture both strict and statistical self-similarity across a range of spatial scales.

Purpose: Our objective is to design, develop, and apply innovative fractal descriptors that reliably quantify the structural and functional complexity of the brain. We aim to employ these descriptors to study both healthy individuals and patients with neurological disorders. By leveraging fractal analysis, we seek to gain insights into brain maturation, aging processes, and the manifestation of various neurological conditions.
